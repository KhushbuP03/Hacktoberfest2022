ScriptLess Testing 
What is Scriptless Test Automation and Why Use It?
Scriptless test automation is an approach wherein users can automate test cases even if they lack in-depth knowledge of the code. Automated tests are generated through this process by validating the test automation logic.

Users barely have to write a piece of code to automate a test case. They only need to indicate which step needs to be carried out next instead of writing the code themselves.

However, scriptless test automation doesnâ€™t mean that coding or test scripts are completely eliminated. It rather simplifies the entire process to make it easier for humans to perform.
